Imagine you have been given the DeFi1 contract by a colleague and asked to test it using Foundry.
Your colleague explains that the contract allows
- investors to claim tokens, but the amount that they can claim should go down each block.
- investors to be added by the administrator

Make sure you know
 - how would you advance blocks, 
 - how would you make sure every block will work 
 - how would you make sure the contract works with different starting values such as 
 	- block reward, 
	- numbers of investors
	- initial number of tokens

Try to find all the bugs  / security problems / optimisation opportunities  in the contract. 
You do not need to fix the code.
