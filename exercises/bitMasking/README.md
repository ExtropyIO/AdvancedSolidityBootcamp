Simple challenges using bit shifting and bit masking

## Bit Masking

Pass all tests by writing your solution in `./src/BitMasking.sol`

> **Note** The expectation is to use yul or solidity to complete the exercises with `and`, `or`, `xor`, `shl` or `shr`

1. Run the tests

```zsh
forge test --match-contract BitMaskingTest -vvv
```
